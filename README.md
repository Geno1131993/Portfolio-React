Portfolio-React
Author: Danielle Smith (UKKA)
Purpose: A rework of a previous portfolio idea, redesigned to appear more professional and to demonstrate React proficiency. The React app is currently hosted on Heroku.

A mobile/device version is currently not supported, this is coming later.

This project is still in progress.
