Portfolio-React
Author: Danielle Smith (UKKA)
Purpose: A rework of a previous portfolio idea, redesigned to appear more professional and to demonstrate React proficiency. The React app is currently hosted on Heroku.

https://dsmith-portfolio-react.herokuapp.com/projects

It is currently desktop and mobile compatible.

Planned improvements:

-- On the About page, a matrix of artwork photos will be added to demonstrate tile structure
-- On the About page, the slides will "slide" left and right
-- On the Projects page, links to Heroku pages will be added
